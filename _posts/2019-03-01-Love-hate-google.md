Nowadays, unless you are called [Richard Stallman](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2200967/software-cell-phones-are-stalin-s-dream-says-free-software-movement-founder.html), you are probably carrying an smartphone in your pocket. That means that we are almost constantly online and that brings us great new opportunities. By far the easiest way of taking advantage of this new technology is making use of the cloud services of the main vendors such as [Android](https://www.android.com/) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/) provide, normally starting with a free-tier.

## Getting hooked on Google

Being myself traditionally an early-adopter, and being a fan of their search engine, I quickly jumped to try lots of [Google](http://www.google.com/)'s services. Even before having an smartphone I was already using several services, like [GMail](https://www.gmail.com/) or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/). With time, I started using many other services from them as they keep providing and ever more integrated experience:

 * Search
 * Email (Gmail)
 * Calendar
 * Analytics
 * Advertising (Adsense)
 * Blogs (Blogger and Google Reader)
 * Maps
 * Photos
 * Browser (Chrome)
 * Video-conference (Youtube)
 * Music (Google Play) and video streaming (Youtube)
 * Document and file sharing
 * Smartphone OS (Android)

## Trying to find some alternatives

However with time I was getting more concerned about the amount of information they were most definitively gathering about me, and actually after [they went public](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/opinion/google-goes-public.html) they even [stopped trying not to be evil](http://time.com/4060575/alphabet-google-dont-be-evil/), made me think about other alternatives.
